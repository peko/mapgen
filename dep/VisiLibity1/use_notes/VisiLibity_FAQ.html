<h1> VisiLibity Frequently Asked Questions </h1>


<br><h3>I am getting computation errors.  What should I do?</h3>

Programs may crash if (1) the robustness constant &epsilon is chosen
poorly, or (2) the environment model is not &epsilon -valid (see
answer to next question).  Before reporting a bug, try varying
&epsilon by a few orders of magnitude in both directions or checking
evironment &epsilon -validity using the Enviroment::is_valid method.
Note &epsilon should never be set to zero except when performing
certain debugging procedures on the VisiLibity code itself.  To start,
try setting &epsilon to a number a couple orders of magnitude smaller
than the smallest featrure in the environment, e.g., double &epsilon =
0.0000001; This means you must include an &epsilon in all function
calls, i.e., do not use the default argument &epsilon=0.0.  For
example, you need to add &epsilon at Visibility_Polygon(observer, env,
epsilon).


<br><br><h3> Will VisiLibity work for polygonal environments where the
edges of distinct polygons intersect?</h3>

No, VisiLibity R-1 is not meant to operate on environments where edges
of distinct polygons intersect.  For correctness of computation, in
addition to choosing suitable &epsilon, the environment must be ``
&epsilon -valid''.  This can be checked using the
Environment::is_valid() method.  An environment is &epsilon -valid if
none of its outer boundary or holes intersect each other, and there is
a distance at least &epsilon between any features (vertices and
edges), and there can be no redundant vertices (e.g. don't list the
first vertex redundantly also as the last) in the polygon vertex
lists.

<!-- Real GIS data sets may have many overlapping polygons
representing buildings.  Although I have not implemented it, it is
possible to robustly compute shortest paths with such environments,
but at the expense of slower computation time.  I plan to fix this in
the next version of VisiLibity.  The software is not intended to work
with polygons that overlap (nor that self-intersect).  The Environment
must be &epsilon -valid for an &epsilon reasonably larger than machine
precision, which can be checked by the method
VisiLibity::Environment::is_valid as defined in the documentation:-->

<p>
If your environment is not &epsilon -valid and you want VisiLibity to
work for your application, then you must perform preprocessing to
enforce &epsilon -validity.  I plan to remove the &epsilon -validity
precondition in the next version of VisiLibity; until then I
appologize for the inconvenience.


<br><br><h3>Should I cache a Visibility_Graph if I'm performing many
shortest path queries in the same Environment?</h3>

Yes.  Here's how:
<br>
1) Define a small &epsilon like this:
double epsilon = 0.000000001;
This is very important, otherwise there are robustness/degeneracy problems.
<br>
2) Construct your environment like this:
VisiLibity::Environment environment( filename );
<br>
2) Construct the visibility graph like this:
VisiLibity::Visibility_Graph visibility_graph( environment, epsilon );
<br>
3) Make path queries like this:
Polyline path = environment.shortest_path( startpoint, endpoint, visibility_graph, epsilon );


<br><br><h3>I am unable to compile VisiLibity under Microsoft Windows.
What should I do?</h3>

VisiLibity R-1 uses definitions which do not exist in the Microsoft
Visual Studio compilers.  To add these definitions, uncomment these
lines in the header visilibity.hpp

<pre>
//Uncomment these lines when compiling under
//Microsoft Visual Studio
/*
#include&lt;limits&gt;
#define NAN std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::quiet_NaN()
#define INFINITY std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::infinity()
#define M_PI 3.141592653589793238462643
#define and &&
#define or ||
*/
</pre>

Alternatively, you could get a Gnu compiler working on your machine.
Some helpful hints on getting a Gnu complier running on a Windows
machine can be found under <A
href="./VisiLibity_Matlab_Windows.notes.txt">Notes on Matlab
Interface under Windows</A>.


<br><br><h3> How do I make VisiLibity work on a 64-bit machine?</h3>

To compile VisiLibity on a pure 64-bit system, add -fPIC to the
CXXFLAGS in the makefile.  Also, if Matlab does not link to the
correct libraries, try changing the symlinks in
/usr/local/MATLAB/R2010b/sys/os/glnxa64/ to the correct ones in
/usr/lib/
