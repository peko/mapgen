_Making_VisiLibity_Work_on_Windows_+_Matlab_

The default compiler in Matlab, Lcc, is a pure C compiler that cannot
compile C++ source code.  Below are two alternative approaches to
making matlab work with C++.



_With_MSVC++_

Try compiling with MSVC++ in the Matlab environment by the following
commands:

mex -c visilibity.cpp
mex -v visibility_graph.cpp visilibity.obj
mex -v visibility_polygon.cpp visilibity.obj
mex -v shortest_path.cpp visilibity.obj
mex -v in_environment.cpp visilibity.obj



_With_gcc_

If you encounter errors when trying to compile with the MSVC++
compiler supported by matlab, there is an opensource project gnumex
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex/) that can make Matlab support
gcc.  The solution needs some additional configurations to Matlab and
tiny modifications to the mex-prepared C source files.  My software
environment is Windows XP SP3 + Matlab 7.0.1.24704(R14) SP1.  For
compiling the VisiLibity library, a Windows version gcc and an
extension of gcc support for Matlab are necessary. I use MinGW 5.1.4
(http://www.mingw.org/) and gnumex 2.01.

Main steps:

1.  Compile visilibity.cpp into visilibity.o with gcc
gcc -c visilibity.cpp

3.  Install MinGW and gnumex, and config the gnumex in Matlab. The
detailed configuration instructions can be found here
http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/

4. Compile the four mex-prepared cpp files in matlab's prompt:
mex -v xxxx.cpp visilibity.o
and get the corresponding dll files

5. Run the demo .m files

I suspect the source codes can be compiled by msvc compiler.
